The 'npm test' command failed because there is no "test" script defined in the project's package.json file.

However, I have successfully:
1.  Implemented the "About" page with team details and activity photos, including styling enhancements.
2.  Implemented the dynamic quiz functionality for all courses, including:
    *   Dynamic quiz pages with quiz logic, scoring, and pass/fail conditions.
    *   All quizzes translated to Indonesian with a maximum of 10 questions.
    *   "Take Quiz" buttons and CTA sections added to all course pages.
3.  Implemented the dynamic certificate page.
4.  Resolved all parsing and runtime errors during development, including the persistent "params is a Promise" error.
5.  Successfully built the project, confirming all changes are syntactically correct and compatible.

To view the changes, please run the development server:
`npm run dev`

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated in the terminal) in your browser. You can access the "About" page from the navigation bar, and the quizzes from any course page.# ngodingyuk_elerningcoding
